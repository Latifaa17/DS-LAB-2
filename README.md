## About 
In this project, we aim to leverage
pre-trained models in order to summarize lectures. The main challenge
is that the data used has no human-written reference summaries. To
overcome the problem, we used a metric that does not require reference
summaries. Results showed that BART model outperformed BERT and
Pegasus.
